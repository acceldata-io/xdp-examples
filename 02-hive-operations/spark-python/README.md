# Hive Operations Python Examples

This directory contains Python examples for performing Hive operations using Apache Spark with Kerberos authentication. The main script demonstrates how to:

- Connect to Hive using SparkSession
- Handle Kerberos authentication and renewal
- Create a Hive database and table
- Insert, read, and delete data in Hive

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Set the required environment variables for Kerberos and Hive connection.
3. Run the main example:
   ```bash
   python hive_operations_example.py
   ```

See the main script for details on required environment variables and Kerberos setup.
